# Earthquake-Plotting
Code URL: https://github.com/stokljos/Earthquake-Plotting/blob/master/Project_3_Tech.ipynb

Introduction:

	This project is using data from USGS to look at earthquakes off the pacific west for the past 
  10 years. We can plot every earthquake and see if there is any correlation between the year, 
  the size of the earthquake and where they line up with the with the relative tectonic zones off 
  the cost. This includes the pacific plate and the Juan de Fuca plate.
  
Procedure (explanation of code):

My code is made up of 6 cells:
1.	Imports relevant packages that is needed relevant to the project
2.	Installs and imports Basemap which is what I used to plot the earthquakes
3.	Gets the URL of the data from github
4.	Converts data into dataframe and pulls out the relevant sections needed for the analysis
5.	Plots Map with the earthquakes relevant in size to each other
6.	Plots magnitude of the earthquakes vs time
7.	Plots earthquakes in April of 2015

Analysis:

a.	Across what geographic area are you able to observe earthquake data in this map? Why do you 
see most of the earthquakes in that area?
  •	The area that I observed was off the coast of San Francisco up to British Columbia. The area 
  also includes the Juan De Fuca Plate.
  •	The area that we see the most earthquakes is right off San Francisco and up north towards 
  Washington.

b.	What is the range of earthquake size (magnitude) in these data? What is the average earthquake
size in this area? 
  •	Regarding graph 1, the smallest earthquakes recorded is 2.5 and the highest recorded is close to 
  a magnitude of 7
  •	The average size is going to be around a magnitude of 3

c.	Map the earthquakes in April 2015 (include this map in your report). Where are those earthquakes
mostly located? What event can you link these earthquakes to?
  •	Regarding graph 4, we can see at 2015, most of them around day 24 and there are 8 earthquakes that
  range from 2.5 to 5.5.
  •	There was an earthquake off BC Canada coast on April 24th of 2015. It was reported as a 6.1, but 
  according to the data it was only a 5.5

d.	What kind of patterns in earthquake magnitude and location you observe over time along each
boundary?
  •	Looking at graph 1, we see in every year, that there are a ton of earthquakes between the 
  magnitude of 2.5 and 3, but in terms of higher magnitudes, it seems that there is a steady amount 
  of earthquakes at 5-5.5 in magnitude, but looking at the graph there is a cycle every two years of
  earthquakes above 5.5 in magnitude.
  
Conclusion:

	In conclusion, the graph I want to talk about is graph 3. There is a pattern with the outline of 
  the plates and the number of earthquakes. We see there is a plethora of earthquakes and their size 
  that follow the plates, and only two earthquakes outside of this region. There is also a lot of 
  earthquakes along the coastline which will be the subduction line. It proves the point that where 
  ever these plate meet, there is going to be a consistent amount of earthquakes and the points where 
  three plates meet up, they will be larger in size.
